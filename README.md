# yt-dlp-for-Brighteon
yt-dlp doesn't support downloading Brighteon playlists with proper video names, so I made some bash code to help. 

For anyone with [this issue](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/2017), use [download-brighteon-channel.sh](https://github.com/PeteSumners/yt-dlp-for-Brighteon/blob/main/download-brighteon-channel.sh).

## Usage
### Channels
Do `./download-brighteon-channel.sh (BASE channel url here: NOT a videos/playlist page)`. The script will take care of the rest!

### Playlists
Do `./brighteon-playlist-to-videos.sh (put your playlist url here)`. Then chillax.

## Dependencies
