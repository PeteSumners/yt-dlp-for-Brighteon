# yt-dlp-for-Brighteon
yt-dlp doesn't support downloading Brighteon playlists with proper video names, so I made some bash code to help. 

For anyone with [this issue](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/2017), I'll still be working on a way to download entire channels. Coming soon!

## Usage
Just do `./brighteon-playlist-to-videos.sh (put your playlist url here)`. The script will take care of the rest!
